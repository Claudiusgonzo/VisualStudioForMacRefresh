### [https://aka.ms/vs4mac-event](https://aka.ms/vs4mac-event)
On February 24th we broadcasted a full day of technical content showing how to build .NET applications on your Mac using Visual Studio for Mac. This repo contains creative and technical content so you can follow along as you watch the recordings and use them in your own virtual events, blog posts, etc. 

> Note: While we previously mentioned the opportunity to run local events in your community, we're currently taking a wait and see approach with this due to COVID-19. If you'd like to register your interest in running a local event in the future, contact us at mailto:vs4maceventqa@microsoft.com.

# Technical Content
The `Technical` folder contains the technical content from the event. Relevant demos are linked to in the decks. 

# Creative & Social Copy 
The `Creative` folder contains creative banners and images you can use to advertise the Visual Studio for Mac: Refresh(); and your own virtual and local events. You may use these banners to advertise the main event itself, or your own virtual or local events. You may add your local meetup name, location and dates to these images. You may not change the Visual Studio 2019 launch event branding. Please contact [vs4maceventqa@microsoft.com](mailto:vs4maceventqa@microsoft.com) if you have any questions.

Please help us promote the Visual Studio for Mac: Refresh(); event on social media! On Twitter, use the hashtag [#VS4MacRefresh](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23VS4MacRefresh).
